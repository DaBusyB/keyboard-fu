BUGZ:
Bold/Italic faces of Puritan not available

[done] Global or per-hotkey url black lists. Don't want these hotkeys on sites like gmail or jira.
    Implementation Notes: One filter list per hotkey, and one global filter
    list. For each hotkey, a master filter list is built by appending the global
    list to its local list. In the list, if a pattern begins with `-`, it is a
    disallow pattern, othwerise, it is an allow pattern. The url is matched with
    each pattern *in order* with the patterns in the master list. Stop at the first
    match. If this matched pattern is a disallow pattern, do not load hotkey, else,
    load it.
